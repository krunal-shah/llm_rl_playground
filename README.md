# llm_rl_playground
Build an LLM and RL environment from ~scratch. 

Note: LLM tools were/will be consulted during development but no copy-paste or direct contributions will be made by any LLM tools. All code will be manually typed on a keyboard. 
The purpose of this repository is to aid my learning and give me a practical playground to interactively learn RL.
